Sure, let's break it down.

SQLAlchemy provides a high-level API to communicate with relational databases, using SQL language and Python. It includes an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer, which allows you to interact with your database, like you would with SQL. In other words, it's a way to create, retrieve, update and delete records in your database using Python.

Now, to your questions:

1. **Session**: In SQLAlchemy, a Session is the home for all objects loaded into the database context for a particular unit of work. It provides the entry point to communicate with the database. A new Session object is created using `sessionmaker()`, which is typically configured with a `Connection` and `Engine`.

    ```python
    from sqlalchemy import create_engine
    from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

    engine = create_engine('sqlite:///example.db')
    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
    ```

    Then, `Session` can be used to create a new Session object:

    ```python
    session = Session()
    ```

    The `Session` instance is not a connection, it represents a "workspace" of all operations which will be eventually committed together to the database. It's a holding zone for all the objects which you've loaded or associated with it during its lifespan. It provides identity map pattern (unique object per row) and unit of work pattern (all changes are applied to the database in one transaction).

2. **Models**: Models in SQLAlchemy are Python classes that are derived from `sqlalchemy.ext.declarative.api.DeclarativeMeta`. They describe the structure of the database tables they will be mapped to. When you define a model, you create a new class, and SQLAlchemy creates a copy of this class as a new table in the database. Each attribute of the class represents a column in the table.

    In your example, `GamePlayer` is a model that represents the 'game_players' table in your database. It has two columns, 'game_id' and 'player_id', which are both foreign keys linking to 'games' and 'players' tables respectively. It also has two relationships 'player' and 'game', which link to the 'Player' and 'Game' models.

3. **How does the model have access to a session?**: The session can be imported from wherever it was instantiated. It's common to define the session in a separate module and import it in the models or wherever it's needed. However, in a larger application, you'll want to consider using scoped sessions, which are thread-local sessions.

    ```python
    from sqlalchemy.orm import scoped_session, sessionmaker
    from sqlalchemy import create_engine

    engine = create_engine('sqlite:///example.db')
    session = scoped_session(sessionmaker(bind=engine))
    ```

    Now, you can import `session` from this module in your `GamePlayer` class and use it.

    ```python
    from .database import session
    ```

4. **Handling multiple connections**: If you have multiple users, each user gets their own session, which is established when they start their work and closed when they're finished. This can be handled using context managers, which automatically commit the changes and close the session when the work is done.

    ```python
    with session.begin():
        # perform operations
    ```

Remember, SQLAlchemy session does not represent a connection, rather it represents a transaction. Connections are created and released as needed by the session. When a session begins a transaction, it acquires a connection from a pool of connections maintained by the Engine, and holds onto it until the Session is committed or rolled back.

These are some basic concepts. I recommend reading the SQLAlchemy documentation to get a deeper understanding.
