For the game state, you could use a JSON object to store the positions of
pieces on the game board. Each piece could be an object with properties for
type (what kind of piece it is), position, and owner (which player it belongs
to). This would allow you to easily re-render the game state at any point.

```json
{
  "pieces": [
    {
      "type": "queen",
      "position": [0, 0],
      "owner": "player1"
    },
    {
      "type": "ant",
      "position": [1, 0],
      "owner": "player2"
    },
    // more pieces...
  ]
}
```

For the action, you could also use a JSON object to describe what action
a player has taken. An action could have a type (like "move", "place", etc.),
the piece it applies to, and any other info necessary for that action (like the
destination for a move).

```json
{
  "type": "move",
  "piece": {
    "type": "queen",
    "owner": "player1"
  },
  "destination": [1, 1]
}
```

This would also make it easy to validate actions by checking the properties of
the action object. For example, to validate a move, you could check that the
piece being moved belongs to the player whose turn it is, and that the
destination is a valid position on the board.

In SQLite triggers, the `NEW` keyword is used to reference the new row being
inserted or updated. However, SQLite has limited support for JSON, and you
can't directly reference properties within a JSON object in a trigger.

You could, however, create a trigger that fires when a new transaction is
inserted and performs some action based on the `action` column. But the trigger
would be working with the JSON as a text string, and would have to use SQLite's
JSON functions to extract and work with data within the JSON.

Here's an example of what a trigger might look like:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER game_update
AFTER INSERT ON transactions
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  -- do something based on NEW.action, using SQLite's JSON functions
  -- e.g., update the game state stored in the games table
  UPDATE games
  SET state = json_insert(state, '$.pieces', json_extract(NEW.action, '$.piece'))
  WHERE id = NEW.game_id;
END;
```

1. `json_extract(json, path)`: This function retrieves the value at the
   specified JSON path from a JSON string. In the context of your Hive game,
   you could use it to get the type of a piece from an action:

```sql
SELECT json_extract(action, '$.piece.type') AS piece_type
FROM transactions
WHERE game_id = 1;
```

2. `json_insert(json, path, value)`: This function inserts a value at
   a specified JSON path. You could use it to add a new piece to the game
   state:

```sql
UPDATE games
SET state = json_insert(state, '$.pieces[0]', '{"type": "ant", "position": [0, 0], "owner": "player1"}')
WHERE id = 1;
```

3. `json_remove(json, path)`: This function removes the value at a specified
   JSON path. You could use it to remove a piece from the game state:

```sql
UPDATE games
SET state = json_remove(state, '$.pieces[0]')
WHERE id = 1;
```

4. `json_set(json, path, value)`: This function sets the value at a specified
   JSON path. You could use it to change the position of a piece:

```sql
UPDATE games
SET state = json_set(state, '$.pieces[0].position', '[1, 1]')
WHERE id = 1;
```

5. `json_type(json, path)`: This function returns the type of the value at the
   specified JSON path. You could use it to check the type of a piece:

```sql
SELECT json_type(action, '$.piece.type') as piece_type
FROM transactions
WHERE game_id = 1;
```

Remember that SQLite's JSON functions can only handle JSON that is properly
formatted, and will return NULL if the JSON or the path is invalid.

Here is a sample JSON object that encapsulates the state of a Hive game:

```json
{
  "gameId": "game123",
  "players": [
    {
      "playerId": "player1",
      "bugs": [

          "type": "Scarab",
          "position": {
            "x": 5,
            "y": 5,
            "z": 0
          },
          "status": "Active"
        },
        {
          "type": "Tarantula",
          "position": {
            "x": 4,
            "y": 5,
            "z": 0
          },
          "status": "Active"
        },
        // more bugs...
      ],
    },
    {
